            <p class="lead">Version control is a type of system that allows you to record file changes over time, and it will allow you to go back to a previous state of the file later. Version control is a main repository that allows you to share files with team members and they can edit them as well. This topic interests me because I like how you can share you project files with multiple people and we can all edit it without any problems. This topic is relevant to the course because you are learning about how to have a backup for your files and it is good to know how to use as we are using it in our assignments.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems is a part of version control, but with version control systems you are able to make changes to the file and know who made the changes. You can see when the changes were made, revert the file to a previous state, see who caused a problem and when, see what is different or new with the file, etc. This topic interests me because you know that with version control systems if you mess up, you can always go back and fix it and see exactly where you went wrong. This topic is relevant to the course because as you are developing websites you want to have all your files saved and you want to be able to edit them or go back to a previous edit. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Centralized version control systems are one server that has all of your versioned filed, clients are able to see the files from the central VCS server. CVCs were developed so that you could be able to collaborate with developers. 	What is bad about CVCs is that if the server goes down then no one is able to go on it and work until it is running again. This topic interests me because I find it interesting how with CVCs you are able to administer what people are able to do. This topic is relevant to the course because it is good to know the down sides to CVCs for future reference.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Distributed version control systems are repositories where clients are able to view the whole thing and all of its history. With this type of system, you are able to have several remote repositories so that various people can work at the same time. This topic interests me because I like how if something goes wrong a client is able to back up the server and make a clone. This topic is relevant to the course because it is good to know with web development that you are able to work with multiple people at once without it being a centralized system. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a type of version control system that is free for all. With Git everyone is able to store data in their machine, it is local meaning you can use it while you are offline, it has no disadvantages, runs very fast, prevents overwrite on shared repositories, etc. Git has its own basic and remote command you need to learn and it has three basic steps: add, commit and push. This topic interest me because it is a free and easy way to store data. This topic is relevant to the course because we are actually learning how to use Git on our assignments.
